## v0.1 Release Notes

We want to release a broadly functional UI with ``v0.1``. After spinning up hundreds of clusters and tweaking tons of things, we are ready to ship ``v0.1``.

### Infrastructure Configurability

We decided to focus on AWS as our underlying infrastructure provider for this release. Autopilot offers a quick setup deployment for the novice user and at the same time comes with an advanced deployment setup configurable down right to the **VPC** and **subnet groups** for the advanced user.

### Elasticsearch Configurability

Aside from the infrastructure configurability, Autopilot let's you select all major Elasticsearch versions starting ``v1.7`` to the latest ``v2.3``. It also allows configuring cluster level configs, and installing the most popular plugins.

### Kibana

It also supports Kibana deployment, and comes with a nifty username:password access token for a good default security.

### Logging

Logging is supported in ``v0.1`` via papertrailapp. It can be configured once the cluster is deployed.

### Cowbells - Security and Monitoring

The ``v0.1`` interface comes baked in with security and monitoring tabs that allows editing AWS security rules and seeing detailed cluster monitoring from right within the Autopilot UI.

#### That's all, folks!
