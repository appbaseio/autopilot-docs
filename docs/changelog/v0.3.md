# v0.3 Release Notes

``v0.3`` adds important security features to Autopilot, SSH access, 

### 1. SSH Access

``v0.3`` introduces SSH access into the Autopilot provisioned machines. Our core goal with Autopilot is to offer a managed Elasticsearch service without compromising on data security and control.

SSH access marks the first step towards bringing control back. You can read here about [configuring SSH Access](https://github.com/appbaseio/autopilot-docs/blob/master/docs/getting-started/SSH.md).

### 2. SSL Encryption and Domain Names

``v0.3`` introduces SSL encryption with domain name support. Autopilot now generates a [unique-node].autopilotapp.io DNS record with SSL encryption for every node in the cluster.

### 3. Cluster Access Credentials

We are also introducing a cluster wide Basic Auth access credentials (username, password) for domain names. This lets you keep the Elasticsearch cluster open to the world without worrying about exposing your data.

If you are accessing it via browser, the browser should ask for the username, password information. If you are doing this programmatically, you need set a ``Basic Auth`` header with the request to the cluster endpoint(s).
