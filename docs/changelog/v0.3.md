# v0.3 Release Notes

``v0.3`` introduces SSH access into the Autopilot provisioned machines. Our core goal with Autopilot is to offer a managed Elasticsearch service without compromising on data security and control.

SSH access marks the first step towards bringing control back. You can read here about [configuring SSH Access](https://github.com/appbaseio/autopilot-docs/blob/master/docs/getting-started/SSH.md).
