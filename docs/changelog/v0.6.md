Autopilot now fully supports provisioning on **Digital Ocean** alongside AWS, with the same affordable pricing of $0.025 per provisioned node hour. 

Everything that you could do with AWS is now supported on Digital Ocean. You can launch an Elasticsearch cluster on droplets of all sizes ranging from 1 **GB** to 64 **GB**, use SSH keys for direct login and even set periodic backups with an AWS S3 bucket.


## Elasticsearch 5.0 General Availability and with Autopilot

Elasticsearch ``v5.0`` reached General Availability status on October 26th, 2016 and we are making it available on Autopilot on November 3rd, 2016.

That's all folks!
