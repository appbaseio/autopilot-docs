## v0.2 Release Notes

``v0.2`` introduces a major templating block for the Autopilot infrastructure, which will speed up iterating on future infrastructure changes. 

* This version adds full support for Elasticsearch configuration and introduces environment variables, 
* adds support for **Graph**, **Marvel**, **Sense** and **Watcher** plugins,
* and fixes some pesky UI issues.

### Elasticsearch Configurations

Our goal with Autopilot is to offer a no-compromise Elasticsearch experience. In ``v0.1``, we allowed setting four specific configuration parameters. With this release, Autopilot provides a default ES configuration file that can be overridden by user-specific settings. You can enable dynamic scripting, apply custom index settings, mappings, analyzers, you name it!

Elasticsearch's [configuration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html) is a good reference point for diving into all the possibilities.

#### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Autopilot introduces passing Environment Variables to Elasticsearch at run time. ``ES_HEAP_SIZE`` is an important variable. It sets the heap memory that will be allocated to the Elasticsearch Java process.

Environment variables are accessible within configuration file with the ${ENV_VAR_NAME} syntax. This allows adding a dynamic flavor to the configuration file to control for things like cluster size, available heap, storage size.

For instance, data replicas can never be more than the number of nodes deloyed. By assigning it a value of 

```yml
index.number_of_replicas: ${NUM_REPLICAS}
```

and passing ``NUM_REPLICAS`` as an environment variable, the configuration file can work without changing it everytime you change an environment setting.


### Plugins

Autopilot now supports all the popular Elasticsearch and Kibana plugins.

### Logging

Logging can now be enabled during cluster launch phase, as well as updated after the cluster is launched.

### UI Issues

* Fixes login routing issues to a large extent, some were related to updates in DNS routes and some were caused by our Postgres DB timeout.  

#### That's all, folks!
