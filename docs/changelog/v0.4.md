# v0.4 Updates

## Backups and Restore

``v0.4`` introduces the most anticipated Autopilot feature - periodic automated backups for Elasticsearch cluster. All backups are stored as snapshots within a user's **AWS S3** bucket.

Autopilot runs a cron job that collects hourly backups from the Elasticsearch cluster and shows them in a timeline view. It also supports restoring backups to the cluster.

``Note:`` Backups and Restore feature will be offered in a separate production plan when Autopilot reaches public beta.

## System Notifications

Autopilot now provides system notifications for cluster health, disk space, memory usage and task completions (like cluster restore).
