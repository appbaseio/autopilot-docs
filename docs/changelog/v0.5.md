# v0.5 Release Notes

## Introducing DB Forks

In the last update, we introduced a periodic backup and point-in-time restore functionality. In ``v0.5``, we are building on this key feature by introducing a powerful idea - DB forks.

A DB fork is an exact copy of the DB state captured by a backup snapshot in a new configurable compute environment (you can change cluster name, instance type, number of instances in the cluster, and other ES settings).

``Note:`` Like Backups and Restore feature, DB Forks will be offered in a separate production plan when Autopilot reaches public beta. Till then, you can use it with the standard plan.


## Improved Data Availability

Autopilot now provides persistent disk volumes which improve data availability across node failures and instance restarts.

``v0.5`` also introduces a bug fix related to the restore functionality that previously set the Elasticsearch cluster in a yellow state on a restore action. This fix lets the cluster state be green across backups and restore actions.

## Improved System Notifications

``v0.4`` introduced system notifications for cluster health, disk space, memory usage and cluster restore completion.

With ``v0.5``, we expand the system notifications to alert node failures, DB fork status and when the Elasticsearch service comes online.

That's all folks!
